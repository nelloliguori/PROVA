<p>When you come to the “Politecnico” for a lecture, you have to find a classroom. The “Cittadella Politecnica” is too huge, full of different classrooms and laboratories, and you start to turn around it,  wishing to find your target. Don't worry, come on! We have a solution! PoliRoute!</p>

<p>Poliroute is a smart system aimed to guide the user in the “Cittadella”, driving himto his destination. All this is done using an interactive system, composed of arrows made with LEDs and touchscreen on the starting point. In all the area of “Cittadella” some touchscreen were be disposed, which are the starting point. The screen indicates  the users's positionon a map and he can select the destination. The system will calculate the minimum walk and will indicate the color associated to his path. In order to understand how far is the destination, it also indicates the distance. The system will give him a bracelet and the screen gives him the first indication to follow. On the way, he will find some intelligent LED arrows, which sense the presence of the user, and lights on the arrow , indicating the direction  he has to follow. If you miss some indication, the system will recalculate the minimum walk to arrive at destination and a LED arrow will show you the direction to follow. When the user arrives to the destination, the system will understand it and will be ready to have a new user!</p>

<p>The PoliRoute touchscreen are placed in the most efficient way all around the “Cittadella Politecnica”, distributed fairly in different areas. In this way the user can starts from every point, choosing the first screen  he see!   The system will be able to manage many users at the same time, using more arrows with different colors at every corner, each for any user.  </p>

<p>PoliRoute will make easy to find all that you want in the “Cittadella Politecnica”, for professors, students and external guests, with a simple system, easy to follow and optimized to reduce the time needed to go from a point to another one.</p>

<a id="deliverable D2" class="anchor" href="#deliverable D2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DELIVERY D2</h2>
 <p>STAKEHOLDERS: Politecnico, which provides a better service, and users that can enjoy it instead of the map</p>

<p>PURPOSE AND SCOPE </p>
<p> PoliRoute is a system aiming to help people to find their destinations inside "Cittadella Politecnica". There are some "starting point" (i.e. some screens), located near the main entrances of Politecnico, in which the user can choose his destination. If the user knows the name of the room, he will directly type it. Instead, if he doesn't know it, there are some filters able to define the destination room. For example, the user wants to know the room where students of the third year of Telecomunication engeneering are currently attending their class. These informations are enough for the system to guide you in the correct room. After selecting the destination, some LED panels, located in every crossing, will indicate the fastest way to reach it. If the user takes the wrong way, PoliRoute will recalculate the right path. The system is able to manage more than one user, assigning LEDs of different colors to each one. The user can change his destination wherever he is, via Web.</p>

 <p>GLOSSARY</p>
<p>Starting point:  part of the system that consists of a screen where the user indicates the room he wants to reach</p>
<p> Interface:      application run at the starting point and on smartphones, which allows the user to tell the system his destination</p>
<p> Room:           classrooms, laboratories, secretaries and so on, i.e. all the internal spaces in the "Cittadella Politecnica".</p>
<p> Sleep mode:     the bracelet stays on, but it uses low power.</p>
<p> Storage:        list of the active paths</p>

<p>ACTORS</p>
<p> - Everyone who doesn't know how to reach a place in the "Cittadella Politecnica"</p>
<p> - People not good with technology (e.g. smartphones, iPad), who can't search the wished destination</p>

<p>FUNCIONAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>1 --> Bracelet identification, End of the path</p>
<p>1.1 - Bracelet identification The user must be able to be assigned to a specific bracelet, which will be used until the destination is reached 
<p>1.2 - End of the path When the destination is reached, the bracelet must become available for another user.</p>
<p>2 --> Assignment of the username, Assignment of the color, Web page</p>
<p>2.1 - Assignment of the username When the user selects a destination, PoliRoute assigns to him a name (e.g. user35).The user can keep it, or change it to a custom one </p>
<p>2.2 - Assigment of the color After selecting the destination, a color is assigned to the user. In order to reach his destination, the user should follow the arrows lighted with his colour. Different users with the same destination have the same colour. </p>
<p>2.3 - Web Page Whether the wants to change his destination, in the middle of the path, he can go in the web, and, providing his username, he can select the new destination. PoliRoute recalculates the right path to the new destination, and the bracelet assigned to the user must be the same as before.</p> 
<p>3 --> The panels, Location of the panels, Interaction between bracelet and panels, Managment of a multitude of users</p> 
<p>3.1 - The panels The panels must be able to indicate the right direction, using bright arrows. The colour of the arrows is different in order to support more users.</p> 
<p>3.2 - Location of the panels In every place where the user have to make a decision about the direction to follow, there must be a panel.</p>
<p>3.3 - Interaction between bracelet and panels The bracelet should be detected by the panel within a few meters from the panel itself. The arrow remains lit until the bracelet is no longer detected.</p> 
<p>3.4 - Managment of a multitude of users If the panel detects more than one bracelet in his operating range, it must show every arrow sequentially, one arrow every couple of seconds.</p>
<p>4 --> Calculation of the path, Recalculation in case of mistake, Timeout, Definition and use of the filters</p>
<p>4.1 - Calculation of the path The path must be calculated to be the as short as possible.</p> 
<p>4.2 - Recalculation in case of mistake When the user misses an indication and he is detected by an unexpected panel, the system recalculates his right path.</p>
<p>4.3 - Timeout While a bracelet is active, if it isn't detected by any panel for more than 20 minutes, the bracelet goes in sleep mode, and the system removes the path from the storage.</p> 
<p>4.4 - Definition and use of the filters The system is not only able to guide the user to a known room, but also to identify the correct room using i informations given by the user. The filters are: type of degree (e.g. bachelor of science or master of science), choose the area (i.e. Engeneering or Architecture), the course, year of attendance.</p> 
<p>5 --> User interface
<p>5 - User interface On the screen of the starting point the user can choose between two options, one is used when he already knows the room, the other one when he does not, yet. Using the first way, the interface will shows the user the list of all the rooms that can be reached. Instead, using the second one, the user should fill in all the filters presented.</p>
<p>6 --> How to get and give back the bracelets</p>
<p>6 - How to get and give back the bracelets The user can get a bracelet in every starting point. When he ends up using it, then he has to give it back at the nearest starting point, which could be at the exit of the "Cittadella Politecnica".</p> 
<p> NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>NFR 1: Web interface</p>
<p> 1.1 - Implementation</p>
<p> The web interface is useful to insert the users' destination via website. The destination can be declared from "starting point" boxes or own smartphone.</p>
<p> 1.2 - Portability</p>
<p> The smartphone doesn't need any application, but only an internet connection. Therefore, the website must be compatible with the most used mobile internet browsers: Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Safari.</p>
<p> The system should work with any version of Android, iOS and Windows phone.</p>
<p> 1.3 - Efficiency</p>
<p> Users spend maximum one minute to follow the wizard procedure of the web interface and then the path is immediately available.</p>
<p> NFR 2: Language</p>
<p> 2.1 - Usability</p>
<p> The language of the web interface may be chosen by the users through a drop-down menu , thus the web interface has to provide at least Italian and English.</p>
<p> NFR 3: Operating bracelets</p>
<p>3.1 Implementation</p>
<p>Bracelets are composed of a little circuit and its supply.</p>
<p>3.2 - Usability</p>
<p>The inside circuit works normally when users follow his path. Instead, when no path is associated to the bracelet, it goes in sleep mode.</p>
<p>NFR 4: "Starting point" boxes</p>
<p>4.1 - Implementation</p>
<p>These boxes are located in several strategic points of Cittadella Politecnica such as: each entrance, secretary, canteen and so on.</p>
<p>4.2 Efficiency</p>
<p>The boxes are in a limited number because of their high cost.</p>
<p>4.3 - Interoperability</p>
<p>Each box must have an internet connection, a bracelets reader and a touchscreen. It also must always be connected to the system website.</p>
<p>NFR 5: Led panel</p>
<p>5.1 - Implementation</p>
<p>Led panels consist of some leds arranged in order to show all the possible directions. These panels must comunicate with the bracelet of each user located a few meters from them. They must indicate the right path using an arrow...........</p>
